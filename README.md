# Cardiovascular Disease Predictive Model

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease based on patient health data including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical features.

## Dataset

Contains clinical and demographic data used to assess cardiovascular risk.

## Approach

- Data preprocessing and feature selection  
- Model training and evaluation using classification algorithms  
- Performance optimization through hyperparameter tuning  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdeoyeHabeeb/Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction.git
